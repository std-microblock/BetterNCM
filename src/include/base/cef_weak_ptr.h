// Weak pointers are pointers to an object that do not affect its lifetime,
// and which may be invalidated (i.e. reset to NULL) by the object, or its
// owner, at any time, most commonly when the object is about to be deleted.

// Weak pointers are useful when an object needs to be accessed safely by one
// or more objects other than its owner, and those callers can cope with the
// object vanishing and e.g. tasks posted to it being silently dropped.
// Reference-counting such an object would complicate the ownership graph and
// make it harder to reason about the object's lifetime.

// EXAMPLE:
//
//  class Controller {
//   public:
//    Controller() : weak_factory_(this) {}
//    void SpawnWorker() { Worker::StartNew(weak_factory_.GetWeakPtr()); }
//    void WorkComplete(const Result& result) { ... }
//   private:
//    // Member variables should appear before the WeakPtrFactory, to ensure
//    // that any WeakPtrs to Controller are invalidated before its members
//    // variable's destructors are executed, rendering them invalid.
//    WeakPtrFactory<Controller> weak_factory_;
//  };
//
//  class Worker {
//   public:
//    static void StartNew(const WeakPtr<Controller>& controller) {
//      Worker* worker = new Worker(controller);
//      // Kick off asynchronous processing...
//    }
//   private:
//    Worker(const WeakPtr<Controller>& controller)
//        : controller_(controller) {}
//    void DidCompleteAsynchronousProcessing(const Result& result) {
//      if (controller_)
//        controller_->WorkComplete(result);
//    }
//    WeakPtr<Controller> controller_;
//  };
//
// With this implementation a caller may use SpawnWorker() to dispatch multiple
// Workers and subsequently delete the Controller, without waiting for all
// Workers to have completed.

// ------------------------- IMPORTANT: Thread-safety -------------------------

// Weak pointers may be passed safely between threads, but must always be
// dereferenced and invalidated on the same thread otherwise checking the
// pointer would be racey.
//
// To ensure correct use, the first time a WeakPtr issued by a WeakPtrFactory
// is dereferenced, the factory and its WeakPtrs become bound to the calling
// thread, and cannot be dereferenced or invalidated on any other thread. Bound
// WeakPtrs can still be handed off to other threads, e.g. to use to post tasks
// back to object on the bound thread.
//
// If all WeakPtr objects are destroyed or invalidated then the factory is
// unbound from the SequencedTaskRunner/Thread. The WeakPtrFactory may then be
// destroyed, or new WeakPtr objects may be used, from a different sequence.
//
// Thus, at least one WeakPtr object must exist and have been dereferenced on
// the correct thread to enforce that other WeakPtr objects will enforce they
// are used on the desired thread.
