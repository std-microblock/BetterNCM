// A simple thread abstraction that establishes a message loop on a new thread.
// The consumer uses CefTaskRunner to execute code on the thread's message loop.
// The thread is terminated when the CefThread object is destroyed or Stop() is
// called. All pending tasks queued on the thread's message loop will run to
// completion before the thread is terminated. CreateThread() can be called on
// any valid CEF thread in either the browser or render process. This class
// should only be used for tasks that require a dedicated thread. In most cases
// you can post tasks to an existing CEF thread instead of creating a new one;
// see cef_task.h for details.
